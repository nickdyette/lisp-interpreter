# lisp-interpreter
This is a intepreter of the Lisp language within the Python console. The input is broken down into individual tokens by the tokenize and parse functions and is then evaluated by the evaluate function. Upon running, the program initializes an empty envrionment using the Enviro class with its parent pointer being None. The program then starts an Read Evaluate Print Loop in which lines can continuously be inputted until the user passes in 'QUIT'. The interpreter supports variable assignment, function definitions and calls, numerous builtin functions that can be found in the carlae_builtins dictionary and linked lists in the form of the Pair class.
